 - The main Business problem that is being solved here is how can a
   system be created to help big companies control their attrition by
   understanding which employee could leave so as to provide him/her
   some incentives to stay back.   

 - This project was created as a part of the INSAID capstone to help HR 
   Advisories to detect possible employees who may end up quitting the  
   organization. The data was sources from the HRMS where the details of
   all past and current employees were being recorded for the last 15   
   years. 

 - In this project the outcome is a classification where we judge if the
   employee is likely to quit or not. Experimented with various supervised learning methods using SAS to    study the characteristics of employees that are more prone
   to    turn-over (attrition). Performed data cleaning, data
   exploration and    graphical exploration.

   Analyzed the performances of using Random Forest model.
